    <h2>coving the image full background</h2>
    <p>If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:
        
        This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):</p>
